              Marin Golub is founder and current CEO of SOLAROW. He was born in
              Zagreb, capital city of small European country called Croatia. He
              devised company when he was 14 years old, he went for a walk with
              low battery, and he thought about having PowerBank what can be
              charged by solar power. He then made the design for website and
              started his own business. He was selling PowerBanks that can be
              charged and powered by solar energy. As business was growing, more
              peoples joined the team and the company become bigger and bigger.
              From day to day, company was instantly growing until it got to
              where it is now, selling PowerBanks around the world, to millions
              of peoples and happy customers. As you, we are also humans, and we
              can make a mistake, like some big tech companies, but like them,
              we try to improve from day to day, trying to make best possible
              product for fair price. Our products are not perfect, and we know
              it, but we are improving efficiency, quality and eventual bugs in
              every new generation. He started in average conditions of work,
              and look where he is now. If Marin could make it, then you have no
              excuse to say: "I can't!"

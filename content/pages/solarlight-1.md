      Why you should get this lamp over the others you might ask? Well, for
      first, this lamp has chargable battery so you won't need to change it when
      it get empty, you will be able to charge it with your USB cable or solar
      energy which is the main concept. Also, for this price, you get some of
      the amazing features that you won't get with most of the other lamps, like
      already mentioned, solar replenishment of the lamps and more colours than
      regular.
